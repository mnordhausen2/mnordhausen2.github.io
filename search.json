    "section": "",
    "text": "In today’s NFL, quarterbacks and star wide receivers often steal the show, leaving the crucial yet under appreciated work of tight ends in the shadows. Tight ends are asked to block like offensive linemen, catch passes like wide-outs, and adapt to every situation, yet their efforts frequently go unnoticed. That changed in 2018 when George Kittle and his fellow 49ers humorously introduced “National Tight Ends Day,” a celebration that has since become a widely recognized event in the league. But beyond the festivities and social media buzz, a question remains: Does the attention surrounding TE Day translate into heightened performance on the field? Do tight ends rise to the occasion when they’re celebrated, or is it all just hype?\nIn this article, we break down the numbers—analyzing targets, receptions, and fantasy points from 2021 to 2024—to determine if TE Day truly impacts player performance or if it’s simply a fun distraction for fans.\nTo set the stage for this analysis, let’s first examine how tight ends have performed on average during the regular season, before TE Day, over the past four years. The chart below, Average Targets and Receptions per Game (Before TE Day), provides a comprehensive view of the top tight ends’ usage, showcasing their average targets and receptions per game for each year from 2021 to 2024. By separating the data year by year, we can see how consistently these elite tight ends, averaging five or more targets per game, have been utilized in their respective offenses and identify any noticeable trends or shifts in performance.\n\n\nCode\nTEComparison &lt;- TEComparison %&gt;%\n  arrange(Year, -Avg_TGT_per_Game) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Player = factor(Player, levels = unique(Player)))\n\n#Remove Dallas, bye week\nTEComparison &lt;- TEComparison %&gt;%\n  filter(!(Player == \"Dallas Goedert (PHI)\" & Year == 2024))\n\nplot1 &lt;- ggplot(TEComparison, aes(x = Player)) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y = Avg_TGT_per_Game, fill = \"Avg Targets (Season)\"), \n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = Avg_REC_per_Game, fill = \"Avg Receptions (Season)\"), \n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Averages Per Game\", \n    y = \"Name\", \n    title = \"Average Targets and Receptions per Game (Before TE Day)\", \n    subtitle = \"Comparing the top Tight End usage before TE Day (Averaging 5+ Targets)\", \n    caption = \"Source: Fantasy Pros TE Statistics | By Mason Nordhausen\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Legend\", \n    values = c(\"Avg Targets (Season)\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Avg Receptions (Season)\" = \"#ff7f0e\"),\n    labels = c(\"Avg Receptions (Season)\", \"Avg Targets (Season)\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 8), \n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    panel.spacing = unit(2, \"lines\"),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Year, scales = \"free_x\", nrow = 1)\n\nplot1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our initial analysis, we observed that the top tight ends in the league typically receive around six targets per game, converting a high percentage of those opportunities into receptions. This consistent baseline gives us a solid reference point to evaluate any variations that might occur during the highly anticipated National Tight Ends Day.\nNow, let’s explore whether the increased attention and excitement surrounding TE Day translate into a boost in target volume for these players. Specifically, we compare their average targets per game over the season to the total targets they received on TE Day. By doing so, we aim to understand if this special day results in increased usage or if the hype has minimal impact on their actual performance.\n\n\nCode\nTEComparison &lt;- TEComparison %&gt;%\n  arrange(Year, -Avg_TGT_per_Game) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Player = factor(Player, levels = unique(Player)))\n# Create a plot to compare Avg Targets per Game (Season) to Total Targets on TE Day\nplot2 &lt;- ggplot(TEComparison, aes(x = Player)) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y = Avg_TGT_per_Game, fill = \"Avg Targets (Season)\"), \n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = TGT_day, fill = \"Total Targets (TE Day)\"), \n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Player\", \n    y = \"Targets\", \n    title = \"Comparison of Average Targets (Season) vs. Total Targets on TE Day\", \n    subtitle = \"Analyzing target volume differences for tight ends on TE Day\", \n    caption = \"Source: Fantasy Pros TE Statistics | By Mason Nordhausen\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Legend\", \n    values = c(\"Avg Targets (Season)\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Total Targets (TE Day)\" = \"#ff7f0e\"),\n    labels = c(\"Avg Targets (Season)\", \"Total Targets (TE Day)\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 8), \n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    panel.spacing = unit(2, \"lines\"),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Year, scales = \"free_x\", nrow = 1)\n\nplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, certain big names like Travis Kelce in 2021 and 2024, along with Mark Andrews in 2023, show a significant increase in targets on TE Day compared to their season averages. This suggests that the hype and attention around TE Day can influence game plans, with teams opting to heavily feature their star tight ends when the spotlight is on. It’s clear that for these elite players, TE Day provides an opportunity to shine, and their teams often rise to the occasion by involving them more in the offense.\nHowever, this isn’t the case for every tight end. A striking example is Mark Andrews in 2022, who experienced a dramatic drop-off. Despite averaging nearly 10 targets per game that season, he only managed to see two targets on TE Day. This drop in usage highlights that TE Day does not always affect the game for every team. Game-specific factors like the defensive matchups, injuries, or defensive game plans specifically designed to neutralize star tight ends can play a significant role.\nAnother trend worth noting is the shift in how consistent target volumes have become over the years. In 2023 and 2024, the targets for most tight ends are much closer to their season averages, showing less extreme variability compared to 2021 and 2022. This could indicate a shift in how teams approach TE Day, perhaps with a more balanced and predictable offensive strategy rather than heavily adjusting their game plan. As TE Day has become more ingrained in the NFL culture, it’s possible that teams have found ways to celebrate their tight ends without dramatically altering their usual offensive patterns.\nBuilding on the patterns we’ve observed in target volume, the next step is to understand how these changes translate into fantasy performance. While an increase in targets can suggest greater opportunities for tight ends, it doesn’t always guarantee higher fantasy points. To explore this, we’ll compare each tight end’s average fantasy points per game over the season with the fantasy points they scored on TE Day.\n\n\nCode\n# Use backticks to reference the column name with special characters\nplot3 &lt;- ggplot(TEComparison, aes(x = Player)) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y = `FPTS/G_avg`, fill = \"Avg Fantasy Points (Season)\"), \n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = FPTS_day, fill = \"Fantasy Points (TE Day)\"), \n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Player\", \n    y = \"Fantasy Points\", \n    title = \"Comparison of Average Fantasy Points (Season) vs. Fantasy Points on TE Day\", \n    subtitle = \"Analyzing differences in fantasy performance for tight ends on TE Day\", \n    caption = \"Source: Fantasy Pros TE Statistics | By Mason Nordhausen\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Legend\", \n    values = c(\"Avg Fantasy Points (Season)\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Fantasy Points (TE Day)\" = \"#ff7f0e\"),\n    labels = c(\"Avg Fantasy Points (Season)\", \"Fantasy Points (TE Day)\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 8), \n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    panel.spacing = unit(2, \"lines\"),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Year, scales = \"free_x\", nrow = 1)\n\nplot3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, we observe that tight ends generally performed better on National Tight Ends Day compared to their season averages, often by a significant margin. Interestingly, even though many tight ends did not see a substantial increase in target volume, it didn’t mean they weren’t heavily utilized. It’s possible that they were targeted in high-value situations, such as the red zone, which would increase their opportunities to score touchdowns and boost their fantasy points. This strategic usage highlights that even without a spike in overall targets, tight ends can still deliver impactful fantasy performances.\nConversely, 2021 and 2022 tell a different story. In these years, tight ends, for the most part, did not perform as well as they had in previous games that season. The data shows little to no correlation between TE Day and improved fantasy performance. Even when some players received a decent volume of targets, those opportunities did not always translate into receptions or touchdowns, both of which are crucial for maximizing fantasy points. This indicates that despite the extra attention surrounding TE Day, it doesn’t always guarantee better outcomes on the fantasy scoreboard.\nThe following waffle charts break down the proportion of tight ends who performed above or below their season average in fantasy points on TE Day for each year. This comparison gives us a clearer sense of how TE Day impacts tight end performance across seasons, highlighting whether the celebration truly boosts fantasy outcomes or if the results remain unpredictable.\n\n\nCode\nplot4 &lt;- function(year) {\n  data_year &lt;- TEComparison %&gt;% filter(Year == year)\n  \n  above_avg &lt;- sum(data_year$FPTS_day &gt; data_year$`FPTS/G_avg`)\n  below_avg &lt;- sum(data_year$FPTS_day &lt;= data_year$`FPTS/G_avg`)\n  \n  waffle_data &lt;- c(\"Above Avg\" = above_avg, \"Below Avg\" = below_avg)\n  waffle_plot &lt;- waffle(waffle_data, rows = 5, colors = c(\"#1f77b4\", \"#ff7f0e\"))\n  \n  ggplot() +\n    annotation_custom(ggplotGrob(waffle_plot), xmin = -Inf, xmax = Inf, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf) +\n    labs(\n      title = paste(\"Performance in\", year),\n      x = NULL,\n      y = NULL\n    ) +\n    theme_void()\n}\n\nwaffle_2021 &lt;- plot4(2021)\nwaffle_2022 &lt;- plot4(2022)\nwaffle_2023 &lt;- plot4(2023)\nwaffle_2024 &lt;- plot4(2024)\n\nwaffle_combined &lt;- (waffle_2021 + waffle_2022) / (waffle_2023 + waffle_2024) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Tight End Fantasy Performance on TE Day by Year\",\n    subtitle = \"Proportion of tight ends performing above or below their season average in fantasy points\",\n    caption = \"Source: Fantasy Pros TE Statistics | By Mason Nordhausen\"\n  )\nwaffle_combined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, a striking pattern emerges: a larger proportion of tight ends fell short of their season average in fantasy points on TE Day. This under performance is especially pronounced in 2021, where only one tight end managed to exceed their average fantasy output. This suggests that TE Day in these years did not provide the expected boost in production, even for some of the top-performing players.\nIn contrast, the waffle charts for 2023 and 2024 paint a more favorable picture. More than half of the tight ends who averaged over five targets per game during the season were able to outperform their usual fantasy points on TE Day. This improvement suggests that teams may have started to use their tight ends more effectively in these years, particularly in high-value scenarios like red zone opportunities. In fact, 2024 saw a record-breaking number of touchdowns scored by tight ends , underscoring the strategic emphasis on these players. The consistent involvement of these key players allowed them to make a more significant impact and contribute to game-changing plays.\nUltimately, while TE Day has shown the potential to boost fantasy performance for certain elite players, it remains unpredictable and varies from year to year. For fantasy football managers, this means TE Day can offer great upside, but it comes with inherent risk. In the future it will be fascinating to see whether TE Day can have a consistent, high impact performances or if the excitement remains more of a gamble. As the tradition grows, one thing is certain: tight ends will have their moment, and fans will be watching closely to see if it pays off."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The NFL has changed so much over the past few years, and one thing I’ve noticed is how mobile quarterbacks have started to dominate the conversation. Players like Lamar Jackson, Jalen Hurts, and Josh Allen have brought a new level of excitement to the game, redefining what it means to be a quarterback. These players aren’t just throwing the ball—they’re running, creating plays with their legs, and adding a whole new dynamic to their teams’ offenses. But I started wondering: does all that mobility actually make a difference? Are teams with mobile quarterbacks really more successful, or is it just a flashy trend?\nTo dig into this, I decided to categorize quarterbacks into two groups: Mobile QBs and Non-Mobile QBs. I used a simple rule, if a quarterback was in the top half of Rush Yards Per Game among all quarterbacks for a season, I classified them as “Mobile.” Everyone else went into the Non-Mobile group. I thought this approach would give me a clear way to see how rushing quarterbacks impact their teams compared to those who mostly stay in the pocket. I also only wanted players that played in the majority of the team’s game so that way team stats are not affected by a backup playing for them (13 games)\nTo get the data I needed, I turned to Pro Football Reference. I used different tables within the site to pull data on individual quarterback rushing stats, team offensive metrics like points per game (PPG) and total yards, red zone efficiency, and win-loss records. By combining all of this data, I created a single dataset that links quarterback rushing performance to team success. My goal was simple: find out if having a mobile quarterback leads to better offensive production and more wins.\nThe first thing I wanted to look at was the relationship between quarterback rushing yards and key offensive metrics. My goal was to see if more rushing yards from the QB position correlated with a more productive offense. Below, I’ve put together a scatter plot showing how QB rushing yards connect to points per game, total yards per game, and red zone efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nFirst scatterplot shows almost no correlation between QB Rush Yards and how many Points Per Game (PPG) the offense scores. We can see around the 20-25 PPG is where most QBs fall into and both Mobile & Non-Mobile QBs have a large portion in that range.\nSince there is little correlation between PPG and QB Rush Yards, wanted to next take a look at the Total Yards per game. Since Mobile QBs are dual threat and can help the offense in the air or on the ground does that correlate to the offense being able to pick up more yards over Non-Mobile QB teams.\n\n\nCode\nplot2 &lt;- ggplot(QB_Team_Merged, aes(x = `Y/G`, y = `Total Yards`, color = QB_Type)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"QB Rush Yards Per Game\",\n    y = \"Total Yards Per Game\",\n    title = \"QB Rushing Yards vs Total Yards Per Game\",\n    subtitle = \"Exploring the correlation between QB mobility and offensive production\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Mason Nordhausen\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"QB Type\",\n    values = c(\"Mobile QB\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Non-Mobile QB\" = \"#ff7f0e\"),\n    labels = c(\"Mobile QB\", \"Non-Mobile QB\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.spacing = unit(2, \"lines\"),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\nplot2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis scatterplot explores the relationship between rushing yards per game and their teams’ total offensive yards per game, comparing Mobile QBs and Non-Mobile QBs. The data suggests that teams with Mobile QBs generally achieve higher total yardage, as evident from the clustering of Mobile QBs above the 6,000-yard mark. Interestingly, the number of teams exceeding 6,000 total yards appears to be nearly tied between Mobile and Non-Mobile QBs, suggesting that mobility alone does not guarantee higher offensive output.\n\n\nCode\nQB_Team_Merged &lt;- QB_Team_Merged %&gt;%\n  mutate(`RedZone %` = as.numeric(gsub(\"%\", \"\", `RedZone %`)))\n\nplot3 &lt;- ggplot(QB_Team_Merged, aes(x = `Y/G`, y = `RedZone %`, color = QB_Type)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"QB Rushing Yards Per Game\",\n    y = \"Red Zone Efficiency (%)\",\n    title = \"QB Rushing Yards vs Red Zone Efficiency\",\n    subtitle = \"Investigating the influence of QB mobility on red zone success\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | Analysis by Mason Nordhausen\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),  # Breaks every 10%\n    labels = function(x) paste0(x, \"%\")  # Append '%' symbol to labels\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"QB Type\",\n    values = c(\"Mobile QB\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Non-Mobile QB\" = \"#ff7f0e\"),\n    labels = c(\"Mobile QB\", \"Non-Mobile QB\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),  # Adjust y-axis text size for clarity\n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.spacing = unit(2, \"lines\"),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  )\n\nplot3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Zone efficiency in the NFL varies widely across teams, and while there may not appear to be a strong direct correlation between quarterback mobility and success in the Red Zone at first glance, a closer examination reveals an important trend. The majority of mobile quarterbacks tend to perform above the 55% efficiency line, whereas a significant number of non-mobile quarterbacks have teams that struggle to exceed this threshold. This suggests that mobility can be a key factor when it matters most. Mobile quarterbacks bring the unique ability to create plays in critical moments, whether by extending passing opportunities or deciding to run when defenses overcommit. This adaptability and playmaking ability highlight a strong connection between mobility and increased efficiency in Red Zone situations, where every decision can make the difference in scoring opportunities.\nThese cumulative effects raise an intriguing question: how does this translate into overall team success, as measured by Win Percentage? If rushing yards are closely linked to offensive production and efficiency in critical scoring areas, it’s reasonable to explore whether teams with mobile quarterbacks see a tangible advantage in the win column.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(QB_Team_Merged, aes(x = `Y/G`, y = Win_Percentage, color = QB_Type)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"QB Rushing Yards\",\n    y = \"Win Percentage\",\n    title = \"Win Percentage vs QB Rushing Yards\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparing win percentages of Mobile vs Non-Mobile QBs\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | Analysis by Mason Nordhausen\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    name = \"QB Type\",\n    values = c(\"Mobile QB\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Non-Mobile QB\" = \"#ff7f0e\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart highlights a significant distinction between Mobile and Non-Mobile QBs in terms of Win Percentage. Mobile QBs exhibit a much wider range of Win Percentages, from teams in a rebuilding phase to the very top performers. Notably, the top four QBs in terms of Win Percentage are all Mobile QBs, suggesting that elite mobility can translate into on-field success. While Non-Mobile QBs show more consistency and cluster closer together in terms of Win Percentage, their upper limit doesn’t seem to match that of their mobile counterparts.\nThis supports the idea that while other factors, such as defense and supporting offensive players, contribute to team success, a great Mobile QB can be a game-changer. Teams with lower Win Percentages among Mobile QBs might reflect rebuilding situations, where teams are still constructing a roster to complement their quarterback’s skill set. This variability underscores the potential of Mobile QBs to elevate a team’s ceiling when paired with a strong supporting cast.\nWhile the advantages of Mobile QBs in areas like Win Percentage and Red Zone efficiency, their unique style of play introduces a layer of unpredictability—namely, turnovers. This raises a critical question: does their ability to create outweigh the risks they bring to possession security?\nIt is important to note that by Turnovers in this graph it is including all fumbles (lost or recovered by the offense). Due to the fact that once that ball comes out it is a 50/50 chance for the offense to recover, which is a risk that needs accounted for/\n\n\nCode\nQB_Team_Merged &lt;- QB_Team_Merged %&gt;%\n  mutate(Total_Turnovers = `Interceptions Thrown` + Fmb)\n\nggplot(QB_Team_Merged, aes(x = QB_Type, y = Total_Turnovers, color = QB_Type)) +\n  geom_jitter(size = 3, alpha = 0.8, width = 0.2) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"QB Type\",\n    y = \"Total Turnover Risks\",\n    title = \"The Risk-Reward Balance: Turnovers and Playmaking Between Mobile and Non-Mobile QBs\",\n    subtitle = \"Examining the Variability in Turnover Risks Across Different Quarterback Styles\",\n    caption = \"Source: Pro Football Reference | By Mason Nordhausen\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Mobile QB\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Non-Mobile QB\" = \"#ff7f0e\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile QBs tend to have a wider range of total turnovers compared to Non-Mobile QBs, with some Mobile QBs reaching as high as 30 turnovers. In contrast, Non-Mobile QBs are more consistently clustered between 15 and 25 turnovers. This suggests that while Mobile QBs bring added playmaking potential, their aggressive style of play: such as increased rushing attempts and extended plays—may also lead to a higher turnover risk. Non-Mobile QBs, on the other hand, exhibit less variance, likely reflecting a more conservative and predictable approach to the game. This trade-off highlights the balance teams must strike between high-reward mobility and the potential for costly mistakes.\nUltimately, Mobile QBs represent a high-risk, high-reward paradigm in the NFL. Their ability to extend plays and thrive in high-pressure situations can elevate a team’s performance, but it comes at the cost of increased turnover potential. As the NFL continues to evolve, the question isn’t whether Mobile QBs are better or worse—it’s how well teams can harness their unique strengths while minimizing their vulnerabilities."
