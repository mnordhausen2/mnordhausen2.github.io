Tight ends are asked to block like offensive linemen, catch passes like wide-outs, and adapt to every situation, yet their efforts frequently go unnoticed. That changed in 2018 when George Kittle and his fellow 49ers humorously introduced “National Tight Ends Day,” a celebration that has since become a widely recognized event in the league. But beyond the festivities and social media buzz, a question remains: Does the attention surrounding TE Day translate into heightened performance on the field? Do tight ends rise to the occasion when they’re celebrated, or is it all just hype? In this article, we break down the numbers—analyzing targets, receptions, yards, and fantasy points from 2021 to 2024—to determine if TE Day truly impacts player performance or if it’s simply a fun distraction for fans.\nTo set the stage for this analysis, let’s first examine how tight ends have performed on average during the regular season, before TE Day, over the past four years. The chart below, “Average Targets and Receptions per Game (Season),” provides a comprehensive view of the top tight ends’ usage, showcasing their average targets and receptions per game for each year from 2021 to 2024. By separating the data year by year, we can see how consistently these elite Tight Ends have been utilized in their respective offenses and identify any noticeable trends or shifts in performance.\n\n\nCode\n# Ensure Player is a factor with levels ordered by Avg_TGT_per_Game within each Year\nTEComparison &lt;- TEComparison %&gt;%\n  mutate(Player = factor(Player, levels = unique(Player[order(-Avg_TGT_per_Game)])))\n\n# Now create the plot\nplot1 &lt;- ggplot(TEComparison, aes(x = Player)) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y = Avg_TGT_per_Game, fill = \"Avg Targets (Season)\"), \n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y = Avg_REC_per_Game, fill = \"Avg Receptions (Season)\"), \n           stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Averages Per Game\", \n    y = \"Name\", \n    title = \"Averages of the Top 10 Targeted Tight End\", \n    subtitle = \"Comparing the top Tight End usage before TE Day\", \n    caption = \"Source: Fantasy Pros TE Statistics | By Mason Nordhausen\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Legend\", \n    values = c(\"Avg Targets (Season)\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Avg Receptions (Season)\" = \"#ff7f0e\"),\n    labels = c(\"Avg Receptions (Season)\", \"Avg Targets (Season)\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1, size = 8), \n    strip.text = element_text(size = 12), \n    panel.spacing = unit(2, \"lines\"),\n    legend.position = \"top\"\n  ) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Year, scales = \"free_x\", nrow = 1)\n\nplot1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, top Tight Ends in the league are receiving about 6 Targets per game and catching most of them as they have about 5 receptions per game. We will be able to use that baseline to help show the correlation for TE Day"
